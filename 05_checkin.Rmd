1. (Project Euler Problem 1) The natural numbers less than 10 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these numbers is 23. Write R code to compute the sum of all the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 5.
```{r}
sum_of_numbers <- 0

for (i in 1:999) {
  if (i %% 3 == 0 || i %% 5 == 0) {
    sum_of_numbers <- sum_of_numbers + i
  }
}
print(sum_of_numbers)
```
